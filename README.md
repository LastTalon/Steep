# Steep
Steep is the **Sublime TTS External Editor Plugin**. Its a [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) plugin for editing scripts in [Tabletop Simulator](http://berserk-games.com/tabletop-simulator/). The plugin allows easy modification, testing, and execution of Tabletop Simulator's Lua scripts. This is the Sublime Text counterpart to the provided [Atom Editor Plugin](http://berserk-games.com/knowledgebase/atom-editor-plugin/).

## Installation
The plugin is unfinished and currently there is no installer. You may still install the plugin to test, use, or develop it in its current state.

To install the plugin yourself you may package the plugin in a directory or as a zip compressed file with the extension `.sublime-package`. If you use the directory it should be placed in the `Packages` directory for Sublime Text to load it. If you use the file it should be placed in `Installed Packages`. On windows these are located at `%APPDATA%\Sublime Text 3`, on linux distros at `~/.config/sublime-text-3`, and on mac at `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3`. To simplify this you may `git clone` into the `Packages` directory.

[Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) support will come soon.

## Developing
Developing the plugin is simple. Once installed, modify the files and Sublime Text will reload the plugin.
